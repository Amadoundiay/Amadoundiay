I didn't wait for opportunity. I built the environment, ran the simulations, broke things intentionally, and reverse-engineered why. No shortcuts — just thousands of hours of deliberate practice, log analysis, and failed detections that eventually became good ones.

I don't treat security as a certification track. I treat it as a discipline — one that demands **methodical thinking, forensic precision, and the ability to communicate findings clearly under pressure**. Every investigation I complete is held to the standard of the analysts I study: DFIR Report, Mandiant, Microsoft DART.

The work in my repositories reflects that standard. Not aspirationally — demonstrably.

```
  LOG FIRST.       Not assumptions.
  RECONSTRUCT.     Behavior, not just indicators.
  DETECT.          What, when, and how — not just if.
  COMMUNICATE.     Technical precision, executive clarity.
```
