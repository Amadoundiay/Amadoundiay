I am a Computer Science Engineering student specializing in cybersecurity, with a strong focus on blue teaming and Security Operations Center (SOC) operations. Passionate about securing digital environments, I am dedicated to analyzing threats, detecting vulnerabilities, and strengthening defenses against cyberattacks.

## Objective

My goal is to leverage my technical expertise and hands-on experience in network security, threat detection, and incident response to transition into a SOC Tier 1 Analyst role. I am eager to contribute to a cybersecurity team, continuously learn, and enhance my skills in security monitoring, log analysis, and incident management.
