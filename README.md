🎓 **Cybersecurity Engineering Student**  
🛡️ **Aspiring SOC Analyst (Blue Team)**  
☁️ **DFIR • Threat Hunting • Cloud Security**

I focus on **defensive cybersecurity** with a strong interest in **how attacks unfold in real environments** and how defenders can **detect, investigate, and respond** effectively.

My work blends:
- **Hands-on labs**
- **Threat-hunting investigations**
- **DFIR-style reporting**
- **Detection engineering thinking**

I aim to think and write like a **SOC analyst and incident responder**, not just solve labs.

## 🧭 Professional Philosophy

> *Security is not about tools — it’s about visibility, context, and decision-making under pressure.*

I approach cybersecurity from an **analyst mindset**:
- Start with logs, not assumptions
- Reconstruct attacker behavior step by step
- Focus on **what can be detected, when, and how**
- Translate technical findings into **clear, actionable reports**

---

## 🎯 Career Objective

Aspiring **SOC Analyst (Tier 1)** seeking opportunities to contribute to:
- Continuous security monitoring and alert triage  
- Threat hunting using SIEM and endpoint telemetry  
- Incident response and post-incident analysis  
- Detection improvement through lessons learned  

Long-term goal: grow into **SOC Tier 2 / DFIR / Detection Engineering** roles.

## 📁 Selected Work & Projects

### 🔐 Active Directory Security Lab
📂 [Repository](https://github.com/Amadoundiay/Active-Directory-Project)

- Designed a **realistic Windows Active Directory environment**
- Simulated attacker behaviors such as:
  - Credential abuse
  - Lateral movement
  - Privilege escalation
- Built **Splunk detections** mapped to **MITRE ATT&CK**
- Focused on **visibility gaps and detection opportunities**

> Objective: understand *how AD attacks look from the defender’s side*.

---

### ☁️ Azure Sentinel SOC Lab
📂 [Repository](https://github.com/Amadoundiay/Azure-Sentinel-SOC-Lab)

- Built a **cloud-native SOC lab using Microsoft Sentinel**
- Created:
  - Analytics rules
  - Dashboards
  - KQL threat-hunting queries
- Deployed a **honeypot** to collect real attack telemetry
- Implemented enrichment (GeoIP, WHOIS, reverse DNS)
- Produced **SOC-style reports and attack visualizations**

> Objective: develop **SIEM fluency and investigation discipline**.

---

### 🤖 SOC Automation & Endpoint Telemetry Lab
- Centralized **Sysmon logs** into **Wazuh**
- Automated triage and enrichment using **Shuffle SOAR**
- Detected:
  - Credential dumping behaviors
  - Suspicious process chains
  - Lateral movement patterns
- Reduced alert fatigue through **workflow-driven response**

> Objective: explore how automation supports analysts, not replaces them.

---

## 📊 DFIR & Incident Analysis Reports

I maintain **structured DFIR-style reports** inspired by real-world incident response publications (DFIR Report, Mandiant, Microsoft IR).

### 🧪 DFIR Case Study (CTF-Based)
📂 [DFIR-CTF-NHS-Spine-Ransomware](https://github.com/Amadoundiay/DFIR-CTF-NHS-Spine-Ransomware)

- End-to-end investigation of a **phishing-led ransomware intrusion**
- Focus on **attacker behavior**, not exploitation
- Evidence-driven analysis using **Microsoft Sentinel & KQL**
- Includes:
  - Executive summary
  - Attack timeline
  - Phase-by-phase analysis
  - IOC scoping
  - Detection opportunities

> This report demonstrates **how I think as an analyst**, not just how I solve challenges.

### 📘 Ongoing & Future Reports
- Phishing intrusion analyses  
- Credential theft & lateral movement case studies  
- Cloud & hybrid environment attack simulations  
- Detection engineering write-ups  

> Goal: build a **public portfolio of DFIR-quality investigations**.
